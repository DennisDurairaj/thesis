\chapter{Conclusion}
On comparing the two performance testing tools, namely JMeter and Loadrunner, we can observe that they yield the similar results as we expected.
\paragraph{}
Since Node is event-driven and single threaded, it performs better in situations that involve a lot of I/O operations, however it's performance suffers when we compare it to more cpu-intensive tasks.
\paragraph{}
PHP performs well when the number of requests is relatively low, but as the number of requests begins to increase, it's performance drops exponentially.
\paragraph{}
.NET uses parallel threads hence it is able to outperform Node and PHP when it comes to CPU intensive tasks.
